# Welcome to Gumdrop!

This is an example site that you can use as a starting point. Or you can just
poke around and see what all can be done and then start with an empty project
by running this (in a non-Gumdrop site folder):

    $ gumdrop new -t blank MY_NEW_SITE

## Lots More

Gumdrop can do quite a lot and is very configurable. Be sure and read the wiki
for documentation and more examples!
