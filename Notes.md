# Future Features/Changes
- HTML Manifest generation??
- Some kind of admin? What would that even do?
  - If you could specify a 'prototype' for data collections, could be cool.
- Multiple source_dir?
  - `set :source_dir, ['./source/a', './source/b']
  - What would happen with conflicts, last one in wins?
- Multiple data_dir too?

# TODO:
- New/Update Doc Site
- API for retrieving pages and pages under a path (simple query)
- Cleanup api and verbiage around blacklisting and ignoring
- YamlDoc support (in data anyway)
- Templates should be stored as short name/path and full path (like partials)
